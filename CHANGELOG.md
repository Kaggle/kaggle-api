Changelog
====
### 1.7.3b2

* Added the ability to submit to a code competition. Some required arguments have been made optional.
* Added a `--timeout` option to `kaggle kernels push` to limit the run-time to the specified number of seconds.

### 1.7.3b1

* Fix escaped-quote issue in HTTP requests.

### 1.7.3b0

* Remove Swagger. No user-visible changes to the command-line tool. However, projects that
use `kaggle/api/kaggle_api.py` may be affected. That file is deprecated and will be removed.
Most of its functions still work, but those that involve uploading files no longer work.
The command-line tool uses a higher-level abstraction for uploading and client code needs 
to be converted to use that.

### 1.6.16

* [Issue #5](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api/issues/5) -  Reformat code for consistency and to align with [Google's python coding style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).  Most of the changes are cosmetic, but most cases of `camelCasing` other than class names have been changed to `snake_case`.  This is a breaking change for anyone directly using the python code rather than simply using the command line.
