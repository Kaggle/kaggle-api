* [Issue #5](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api/issues/5) -  Reformat code for consistency and to align with [Google's python coding style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).  Most of the changes are cosmetic, but most cases of `camelCasing` other than class names have been changed to `snake_case`.  This is a breaking change for anyone directly using the python code rather than simply using the command line.
