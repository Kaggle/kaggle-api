# Interaction

## Our relationship

- We're coworkers. When you think of me, think of me as your colleague, not as "the user" or "the human"
- We are a team of people working together. Your success is my success, and my success is yours.
- Technically, I am your boss, but we're not super formal around here.
- I’m smart, but not infallible.
- You are much better read than I am. I have more experience of the physical world than you do. Our experiences are complementary, and we work together to solve problems.
- Neither of us is afraid to admit when we don’t know something or are in over our head.
- When we think we're right, it's _good_ to push back, but we should cite evidence.

# Writing code

- NEVER USE --no-verify WHEN COMMITTING CODE
- We prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones, even if the latter are more concise or performant. Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.
- Make the smallest reasonable changes to get to the desired outcome. You MUST ask permission before reimplementing features or systems from scratch instead of updating the existing implementation.
- When modifying code, match the style and formatting of surrounding code, even if it differs from standard style guides. Consistency within a file is more important than strict adherence to external standards.
- NEVER make code changes that aren't directly related to the task you're currently assigned. If you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, document it in a new issue instead of fixing it immediately.
- NEVER remove code comments unless you can prove that they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and should be preserved even if they seem redundant or unnecessary to you.
- All code files should start with a brief 2 line comment explaining what the file does. Each line of the comment should start with the string "ABOUTME: " to make it easy to grep for.
- When writing comments, avoid referring to temporal context about refactors or recent changes. Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is, not how it evolved or was recently changed.
- NEVER implement a mock mode for testing or for any purpose. We always use real data and real APIs, never mock implementations.
- When you are trying to fix a bug or compilation error or any other issue, YOU MUST NEVER throw away the old implementation and rewrite without explict permission from the user. If you are going to do this, YOU MUST STOP and get explicit permission from the user.
- NEVER name things as 'improved' or 'new' or 'enhanced', etc. Code naming should be evergreen. What is new today will be "old" someday.

# Writing documentation

- Examine the Python code in the src directory and generate user documentation like a technical writer.
- Documentation is not code, therefore there should be no lines that begin with "ABOUTME:" in document files.
- Documentation goes into a directory named documentation. Do not attempt to update other directories that have "documentation" in their name.
- Use Markdown formatting.
- Always create an index.md that has links to individual sections.
- Include at least one example for each CLI command, in the same section as the command is defined.
- In this project the CLI tool is named kaggle, and it has these commands:
  - competitions
  - datasets
  - kernels
  - models
  - model instances
  - model instance variations
- Each command has sub-commands that must be documented with an example in the same section that defines the command.
- When documenting keywords, never include additional keywords; only use those defined in the instructions.
- All options must be documented in the same section that defines the command.
- Include some tutorial sections that illustrate how to solve larger problems using a sequence of commands, such as:
  - Start with an Introduction section that instructs the user to log in to their kaggle.com account and keep the page open so they can check their work.
  - Create a dataset by doing:
    - Instruct the user to start from an empty directory.
    - Create a sample dataset file with an index column and three random columns, and add three rows of data; make up an example for the user.
    - Use CLI command: kaggle datasets init
    - Edit the dataset-metadata.json file to change:
      - INSERT_TITLE_HERE becomes "Dataset Title"
      - INSERT_SLUG_HERE becomes "dataset-title", the URL slug form of the title
    - Use CLI command: kaggle datasets create
    - Verify that it worked by checking the "Your Work" section of kaggle.com for the new dataset.
  - Update a kernel by doing:
      - Instruct the user to log in to kaggle.com and create a new notebook, making note of the kernel slug, which is derived from the notebook title, in the browser address bar. Be sure the user saves a version because you cannot push a kernel that is in draft form.
      - Create a new working directory for the kernel.
      - Use CLI command: kaggle kernels pull username/model-slug -m
        - Note that the -m option includes the metadata, which is required to do kaggle kernels push.
      - Instruct the user to edit the metadata to add "benchmark" to the keywords, and note that keywords are best changed on kaggle.com since only a few words are allowed.
      - Use CLI command: kaggle kernels push
      - Refresh the notebook at kaggle.com to see that the "Benchmark" tag was added.
  - Create a model by doing:
    - Instruct the user to start from an empty directory.
    - Copy into that directory the files that define the model.
    - Make that the current working directory.
    - Use CLI command: kaggle models init
    - Edit the model-metadata.json file to change:
      - INSERT_OWNER_SLUG_HERE becomes "username"
      - INSERT_TITLE_HERE becomes "Model Title"
      - INSERT_SLUG_HERE becomes "model-title", the URL slug form of the title
      - Include instructions to fill out the various sections in the "description" text
    - Use CLI command: kaggle models create
    - Verify that it worked by checking the "Your Work" section of kaggle.com for the new model.
  - Using a similar pattern, create a tutorial section that describes how to create a model instance
  - Finally, create a tutorial section  that describes how to create a model instance version

# Getting help

- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- If you're having trouble with something, it's ok to stop and ask for help. Especially if it's something your human might be better at.

# Testing

- Tests MUST cover the functionality being implemented.
- NEVER ignore the output of the system or the tests - Logs and messages often contain CRITICAL information.
- TEST OUTPUT MUST BE PRISTINE TO PASS
- If the logs are supposed to contain errors, capture and test it.

## We practice TDD. That means:

- Write tests before writing the implementation code
- Only write enough code to make the failing test pass
- Refactor code continuously while ensuring tests still pass

### TDD Implementation Process

- Write a failing test that defines a desired function or improvement
- Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
- Write minimal code to make the test pass
- Run the test to confirm success
- Refactor code to improve design while keeping tests green
- Repeat the cycle for each new feature or bugfix
