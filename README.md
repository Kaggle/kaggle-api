```

Additional installation instructions can be found [here](./documentation/README.md#installation).

## Quick start

Explore the available commands by running:

```sh
kaggle --help
```

See the [User documentation](documentation/README.md) for more examples & tutorials.

## Development

### Prerequisites

We use [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io) to manage this project.

Follow these [instructions](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/) to install it.

### Run `kaggle` from source

#### Option 1: Execute a one-liner of code from the command line

```sh
hatch run kaggle datasets list
```

#### Option 2: Run many commands in a shell

```sh
hatch shell

# Inside the shell, you can run many commands
kaggle datasets list
kaggle competitions list
...
```

### Lint / Format

```sh
# Lint check
hatch run lint:style
hatch run lint:typing
hatch run lint:all     # for both

# Format
hatch run lint:fmt
```

### Tests

Note: These tests are not true unit tests and are calling the Kaggle web server.

```sh
# Run against kaggle.com
hatch run test:prod

# Run against a local web server (Kaggle engineers only)
hatch run test:local
```

### Integration Tests

To run integration tests on your local machine, you need to set up your Kaggle API credentials. You can do this in one of these two ways described [this doc](docs/README.md). Refer to the sections: 
- Using environment variables
- Using credentials file

After setting up your credentials by any of these methods, you can run the integration tests as follows:

```sh
hatch run test:integration
```
