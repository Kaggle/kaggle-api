Beta release - Kaggle reserves the right to modify the API functionality currently offered.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python and the package manager `pip` installed.

Run the following command to access the Kaggle API using the command line:

## API credentials

To use the Kaggle API, sign up for a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com. Then go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile (`https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account`) and select 'Create API Token'. This will trigger the download of `kaggle.json`, a file containing your API credentials. Place this file in the location `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (on Windows in the location `C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json`).
