The Kaggle API follows the [Data Package specification](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/) for specifying metadata when creating new Datasets and Dataset versions. Next to your files, you have to put a special `dataset-metadata.json` file in your upload folder alongside the files for each new Dataset (version). 

Here's a basic example for `dataset-metadata.json`:
```
{
  "title": "My Awesome Dataset", 
  "id": "timoboz/my-awesome-dataset", 
  "licenses": [{"name": "CC0-1.0"}]
}
```
You can also use the API command `kaggle datasets init -p /path/to/dataset` to have the API create this file for you.

Here's an example containing file metadata:
```
{
  "title": "My Awesome Dataset", 
  "subtitle": "My awesomer subtitle",
  "description": "My awesomest description",
  "id": "timoboz/my-awesome-dataset", 
  "id_no": 12345,
  "licenses": [{"name": "CC0-1.0"}],
  "resources": [
    {
      "path": "my-awesome-data.csv",
      "description": "This is my awesome data!",
      "schema": {
        "fields": [
          {
            "name": "StringField",
            "description": "String field description",
            "type": "string"
          },
          {
            "name": "NumberField",
            "description": "Number field description",
            "type": "number"
          },
          {
            "name": "DateTimeField",
            "description": "Date time field description",
            "type": "datetime"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "path": "my-awesome-extra-file.txt",
      "description": "This is my awesome extra file!"
    }
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "beginner",
    "tutorial"
  ]
}
```

## Contents
The following metadata is currently supported:
* `kaggle datasets create` (create a new Dataset):
  * `title`: Title of the dataset, must be between 6 and 50 characters in length.
  * `subtitle`: Subtitle of the dataset, must be between 20 and 80 characters in length.
  * `description`: Description of the dataset. 
  * `id`: The URL slug of your new dataset, a combination of:
    1. Your username or organization slug (if you are a member of an organization).
    2. A unique Dataset slug, must be between 3 and 50 characters in length.
  * `licenses`: Must have exactly one entry that specifies the license. Only `name` is evaluated, all other information is ignored. See below for options.
  * `resources`: Contains an array of files that are being uploaded.  (Note - this is not required, nor if included, does it need to include all of the files to be uploaded.):
    * `path`: File path.
    * `description`: File description.
    * `schema`: File schema (definition below):
      * `fields`: Array of fields in the dataset.  Please note that this needs to include ALL of the fields in the data in order or they will not be matched up correctly.  A later version of the API will fix this bug.
        * `name`: Field name
        * `title`: Field description
        * `type`: Field type. A best-effort list of types will be kept at the bottom of this wiki page, but new types may be added that are not documented here.
  * `keywords`: Contains an array of strings that correspond to an existing tag on Kaggle.  If a specified tag doesn't exist, the upload will continue, but that specific tag won't be added.  
* `kaggle datasets version` (create a new version for an existing Dataset):
  * `subtitle`: Subtitle of the dataset, must be between 20 and 80 characters in length.
  * `description`: Description of the dataset. 
  * `id`: The URL slug of the dataset you want to update (see above). You must be the owner or otherwise have edit rights for this dataset. One of `id` or `id_no` must be specified. If both are, `id_no` will be preferred.
  * `id_no`: The ID of the dataset. One of `id` or `id_no` must be specified. You must be the owner or otherwise have edit rights for this dataset. If both are, `id_no` will be preferred.
  * `resources`: Contains an array of files that are being uploaded.  (Note - this is not required, nor if included, does it need to include all of the files to be uploaded.):
    * `path`: File path.
    * `description`: File description.
    * `schema`: File schema (definition below):
      * `fields`: Array of fields in the dataset.  Please note that this needs to include ALL of the fields in the data in order or they will not be matched up correctly.  A later version of the API will fix this bug.
        * `name`: Field name
        * `title`: Field description
        * `type`: Field type. A best-effort list of types will be kept at the bottom of this wiki page, but new types may be added that are not documented here.
  * `keywords`: Contains an array of strings that correspond to an existing tag on Kaggle.  If a specified tag doesn't exist, the upload will continue, but that specific tag won't be added.  

We will add further metadata processing in upcoming versions of the API.
