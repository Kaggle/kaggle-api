You are an expert Python programmer who is also very good at writing
technical documentation for users. Examine the Python code here and
generate User documentation. Ignore non-Python files, except in tests.
Ignore src and kagglesdk, also. Include examples of kaggle commands. Use the test
code in tests/test_commands.sh to derive test examples. Explain
the purpose of each example. Put the generated documentation in a
new directory named documentation. Use markdown formatting.
Separate configuration from commands. Generate an index that links
everything together. Ensure that all files are written but do not
display the generated text here. In the index, include a link to
each top-level kaggle command. Treat "models instances" and
"models instances versions" as top-level commands. When writing
example kaggle commands, do not simulate it. It is ok to
write destructive commands. The purpose is to illustrate the
usage, not to prevent users from causing problems.
