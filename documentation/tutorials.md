# Kaggle CLI Tutorials

These tutorials illustrate how to use a sequence of Kaggle CLI commands to accomplish common tasks.

## Introduction

Before starting these tutorials, please make sure you have:

1.  Installed the Kaggle CLI.
2.  Downloaded your `kaggle.json` API token from your Kaggle account page (e.g., `https://www.kaggle.com/settings`) and placed it in the `~/.kaggle/` directory (or `C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\` on Windows).
3.  Logged in to your kaggle.com account in a web browser. This will allow you to easily verify the results of the CLI commands in the "Your Work" section of your Kaggle profile.

## Tutorial: Create a Dataset

This tutorial walks you through creating a new dataset on Kaggle.

1.  **Start from an empty directory.** Create a new directory for your dataset files and navigate into it.

    ```bash
    mkdir my-new-dataset
    cd my-new-dataset
    ```

2.  **Create a sample data file.** For this example, create a CSV file named `sample_data.csv` with an index column and three random data columns, and a few rows of data.

    ```bash
    echo "id,col_a,col_b,col_c" > sample_data.csv
    echo "1,0.5,0.2,0.8" >> sample_data.csv
    echo "2,0.1,0.7,0.3" >> sample_data.csv
    echo "3,0.9,0.4,0.6" >> sample_data.csv
    ```

3.  **Initialize dataset metadata.** This creates a `dataset-metadata.json` file in your current directory.

    ```bash
    kaggle datasets init
    ```

4.  **Edit the metadata file.** Open `dataset-metadata.json` in a text editor and make the following changes:
    *   Replace `"INSERT_TITLE_HERE"` with your desired dataset title, e.g., `"My Sample Dataset"`.
    *   Replace `"INSERT_SLUG_HERE"` with a URL-friendly version of your title, e.g., `"my-sample-dataset"`. The URL-friendly version is made by converting the title to lower-case and changing spaces to dashes.
    *   You can also add licenses, descriptions, and other relevant information.

    *Example using `sed` (for Linux/macOS):*
    ```bash
    sed -i 's/INSERT_TITLE_HERE/My Sample Dataset/' dataset-metadata.json
    sed -i 's/INSERT_SLUG_HERE/my-sample-dataset/' dataset-metadata.json
    ```

5.  **Create the dataset.** This command uploads your `sample_data.csv` and `dataset-metadata.json` to Kaggle.

    ```bash
    kaggle datasets create -p .
    ```
    You can add `--public` to make it public immediately.

6.  **Verify on Kaggle.com.** Go to your Kaggle profile and check the "Datasets" tab in the "Your Work" section. You should see "My Sample Dataset".

## Tutorial: Download a Dataset and Prepare for Analysis

This tutorial explains how to find, download, and prepare a Kaggle dataset for local analysis using the CLI.

1.  **Search for a Dataset (Optional).**
    *   If you know the dataset you want, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can search for datasets. For example, to search for datasets related to "iris":
        ```bash
        kaggle datasets list -s iris
        ```
    *   This command will list datasets matching your search query. Note the dataset's "id" (e.g., `uciml/iris`) which you'll use for downloading.

2.  **Choose a Dataset and Create a Directory.**
    *   For this tutorial, we'll use the classic "Iris" dataset, which has the id `uciml/iris`.
    *   Create a new directory for your dataset and navigate into it:
        ```bash
        mkdir iris-dataset-analysis
        cd iris-dataset-analysis
        ```

3.  **Download the Dataset.**
    *   Use the `kaggle datasets download` command with the dataset's id.
        ```bash
        kaggle datasets download -d uciml/iris
        ```
    *   This will download the dataset files, typically as a ZIP archive (e.g., `iris.zip`), into your current directory (`iris-dataset-analysis`).

4.  **Unzip the Dataset.**
    *   Note: you could skip this step by using the `--unzip` flag on the previous command.
    *   Most datasets are downloaded as ZIP files. You'll need to unzip the archive to access the data files (e.g., CSV files).
        ```bash
        # Make sure you have unzip installed, or use your OS's GUI to extract
        # The actual zip file name might vary based on the dataset.
        # For uciml/iris, it's iris.zip
        unzip iris.zip
        ```
    *   After unzipping, you should see the data files (e.g., `Iris.csv`, `database.sqlite`).

5.  **Prepare for Analysis.**
    *   The dataset is now downloaded and extracted. The primary data file for the Iris dataset is `Iris.csv`.
    *   You can now use your preferred tools (e.g., Python with libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn, R, etc.) to load and analyze the data.
    *   For example, in a Python script within the `iris-dataset-analysis` directory, you might load the data using Pandas:
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv('Iris.csv')
        print(df.head())
        print(df.info())
        ```

This completes the process of downloading a dataset and preparing it for analysis using the Kaggle CLI.
You can adapt these steps for any dataset on Kaggle.

## Tutorial: Update a Kernel (Notebook)

This tutorial shows how to download an existing kernel, modify it, and push the changes back to Kaggle.

1.  **Create or identify a kernel on Kaggle.com.**
    *   Log in to kaggle.com.
    *   Find an existing notebook (or create one). For this tutorial, let's assume its title is "My CLI Test Kernel".
    *   If the notebook has not been saved before, make a small change and **save a version** of the notebook on Kaggle.com (e.g., click "Save Version" and choose "Save & Run All (Commit)"). You cannot pull or push a kernel that is only in draft form.
    *   Note the kernel slug from the browser's address bar. It will be something like `YOUR_USERNAME/my-cli-test-kernel`.

2.  **Create a new local directory for your kernel.**

    ```bash
    mkdir my-kernel-project
    cd my-kernel-project
    ```

3.  **Pull the kernel.** Use the `kaggle kernels pull` command with your username and the kernel slug. The `-m` flag includes the `kernel-metadata.json` file, which is required for pushing updates.

    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual Kaggle username
    kaggle kernels pull YOUR_USERNAME/my-cli-test-kernel -m
    ```
    This will download `my-cli-test-kernel.ipynb` (or `.py`/`.Rmd`) and `kernel-metadata.json`.

4.  **Edit the kernel or metadata.**
    *   Open the downloaded notebook file (e.g., `my-cli-test-kernel.ipynb`) and make some changes to the code or content.
    *   Open `kernel-metadata.json`. Let's add "benchmark" to the keywords. Find the `"keywords": []` line and change it to `"keywords": ["benchmark"]`.
    *   *Note: While you can edit keywords here, it's often best to manage them on kaggle.com, as there might be a restricted list of allowed keywords.*

5.  **Push the kernel.** This uploads your changes and the updated metadata, then runs the kernel on Kaggle.

    ```bash
    kaggle kernels push -p .
    ```

6.  **Verify on Kaggle.com.** Refresh the notebook page on kaggle.com. You should see your code changes and the "benchmark" tag added to the kernel settings.

## Tutorial: Create a Model

This tutorial guides you through creating a new model on Kaggle.

1.  **Start from an empty directory.** Create a new directory for your model files and navigate into it.

    ```bash
    mkdir my-new-model
    cd my-new-model
    ```

2.  **Copy your model definition files (optional for this step).** If you have files that define your model (e.g., Python scripts, model weights), copy them into this directory. For the `kaggle models create` step, only the metadata is strictly required, but you'll need files when you create a model instance.

3.  **Initialize model metadata.** This creates a `model-metadata.json` file.

    ```bash
    kaggle models init
    ```

4.  **Edit the metadata file.** Open `model-metadata.json` and make the following changes:
    *   Replace `"INSERT_OWNER_SLUG_HERE"` with your Kaggle username (e.g., `"YOUR_USERNAME"`).
    *   Replace `"INSERT_TITLE_HERE"` with your model's title (e.g., `"My Awesome AI Model"`).
    *   Replace `"INSERT_SLUG_HERE"` with a URL-friendly version of the title (e.g., `"my-awesome-ai-model"`).
    *   Fill out the `"description"` field and other relevant sections like `"licenses"`.

    *Example using `sed` (for Linux/macOS):*
    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual Kaggle username
    sed -i 's/INSERT_OWNER_SLUG_HERE/YOUR_USERNAME/' model-metadata.json
    sed -i 's/INSERT_TITLE_HERE/My Awesome AI Model/' model-metadata.json
    sed -i 's/INSERT_SLUG_HERE/my-awesome-ai-model/' model-metadata.json
    ```

5.  **Create the model.**

    ```bash
    kaggle models create -p .
    ```

6.  **Verify on Kaggle.com.** Go to your Kaggle profile and check the "Models" tab in the "Your Work" section. You should see "My Awesome AI Model".

## Tutorial: Create a Model Instance

This tutorial shows how to create an instance under an existing model. A model instance usually represents the model implemented in a specific framework (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, etc.) and includes the actual model files.

1.  **Ensure you have a parent model.** Follow the "Create a Model" tutorial if you haven't already. Let's assume your model slug is `my-awesome-ai-model` and your username is `YOUR_USERNAME`.

2.  **Prepare your model instance files.** In your model directory (e.g., `my-new-model`), create or place the files for this specific instance. For example, a JAX model might have a `flax_model.params` file.

    ```bash
    # In the my-new-model directory
    echo "This is a placeholder for JAX model parameters" > flax_model.params
    ```

3.  **Initialize model instance metadata.** This creates `model-instance-metadata.json`.

    ```bash
    # Still in the my-new-model directory
    kaggle models instances init
    ```

4.  **Edit the instance metadata file.** Open `model-instance-metadata.json` and make changes:
    *   Replace `"INSERT_OWNER_SLUG_HERE"` with your Kaggle username (e.g., `"YOUR_USERNAME"`).
    *   Replace `"INSERT_EXISTING_MODEL_SLUG_HERE"` with your parent model's slug (e.g., `"my-awesome-ai-model"`).
    *   Replace `"INSERT_INSTANCE_SLUG_HERE"` with a slug for this instance (e.g., `"jax-implementation"`).
    *   Replace `"INSERT_FRAMEWORK_HERE"` with the model framework (e.g., `"jax"`, `"tensorflow"`, `"pytorch"`, `"sklearn"`).
    *   Update the `"instance_size_bytes"` if known, and add a `"description"`.

    *Example using `sed` (for Linux/macOS):*
    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_USERNAME and my-awesome-ai-model accordingly
    sed -i 's/INSERT_OWNER_SLUG_HERE/YOUR_USERNAME/' model-instance-metadata.json
    sed -i 's/INSERT_EXISTING_MODEL_SLUG_HERE/my-awesome-ai-model/' model-instance-metadata.json
    sed -i 's/INSERT_INSTANCE_SLUG_HERE/jax-implementation/' model-instance-metadata.json
    sed -i 's/INSERT_FRAMEWORK_HERE/jax/' model-instance-metadata.json
    ```

5.  **Create the model instance.** This uploads the files in the current directory (e.g., `flax_model.params`) along with the instance metadata.

    ```bash
    kaggle models instances create -p .
    ```

6.  **Verify on Kaggle.com.** Go to your model's page on Kaggle. You should see a new "jax-implementation" instance listed, and it will have one version containing `flax_model.params`.

## Tutorial: Create a Model Instance Version

This tutorial explains how to add a new version to an existing model instance, for example, when you have updated model weights or files.

1.  **Ensure you have a model instance.** Follow the "Create a Model Instance" tutorial. Let's assume your instance is `YOUR_USERNAME/my-awesome-ai-model/jax/jax-implementation`.

2.  **Prepare your updated files.** In your model instance directory (e.g., `my-new-model`), update or add new files for this version. For example, create `flax_model_v2.params`.

    ```bash
    # In the my-new-model directory
    echo "Updated JAX model parameters for V2" > flax_model_v2.params
    # You might also remove or update flax_model.params if it's being replaced
    ```

3.  **Create the new model instance version.** You need to specify the parent model instance and provide version notes. The files from the `-p` path will form the contents of this new version.

    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_USERNAME and model/instance slugs accordingly
    kaggle models instances versions create YOUR_USERNAME/my-awesome-ai-model/jax/jax-implementation -p . -n "Second version with updated parameters"
    ```
    *Note: The `-p .` means all files in the current directory will be uploaded as part of this new version. If you only want to upload `flax_model_v2.params`, ensure only it (and any other V2 files) are in a directory and point `-p` to that directory, or manage your files carefully.*

4.  **Verify on Kaggle.com.** Go to your model instance page on Kaggle (e.g., `YOUR_USERNAME/my-awesome-ai-model/jax/jax-implementation`). You should see a new version (e.g., version 2) listed with your notes and the new files.

## Tutorial: How to Submit to a Competition

This tutorial walks you through the process of making a submission to a Kaggle competition using the CLI.

1.  **Find a Competition and Accept Rules.**
    *   First, you need to find a competition. You can list active competitions using `kaggle competitions list`.
    *   For this tutorial, we'll use the "titanic" competition, which is a common starting point. You can find it at `https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic`.
    *   **Important**: Before you can download data or submit, you *must* accept the competition's rules on the Kaggle website. Navigate to the competition page (e.g., `https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/rules`) and accept the terms.

2.  **Create a Directory and Download Competition Files.**
    *   Create a new directory for your competition files and navigate into it.
        ```bash
        mkdir titanic-competition
        cd titanic-competition
        ```
    *   Download the competition files. This usually includes training data, test data, and a sample submission file.
        ```bash
        kaggle competitions download -c titanic
        ```
    *   This will download `titanic.zip`. You'll need to unzip it to see the files (e.g., `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `gender_submission.csv`).
        ```bash
        # Make sure you have unzip installed, or use your OS's GUI to extract
        # The actual zip file name might vary based on the competition.
        unzip titanic.zip
        ```

3.  **Create Your Submission File.**
    *   The required format for the submission file is specific to each competition. You can find this information on the competition's "Evaluation" page or by examining the sample submission file (e.g., `gender_submission.csv` for the Titanic competition).
    *   For the Titanic competition, the submission file needs two columns: `PassengerId` and `Survived`. The `Survived` column should contain your predictions (0 for deceased, 1 for survived).
    *   Let's create a very simple submission file based on the `gender_submission.csv` (which predicts survival based on gender). For this tutorial, we'll just copy it and use it as our submission. In a real scenario, you would generate this file from your model's predictions on the `test.csv` data.
        ```bash
        cp gender_submission.csv my_submission.csv
        ```
    *   Your `my_submission.csv` should look something like this:
        ```csv
        PassengerId,Survived
        892,0
        893,1
        894,0
        ...
        ```

4.  **Submit to the Competition.**
    *   Use the `kaggle competitions submit` command. You need to specify:
        *   The competition ID (`-c titanic`).
        *   The path to your submission file (`-f my_submission.csv`).
        *   A message describing your submission (`-m "My first submission via CLI"`).
        ```bash
        kaggle competitions submit -c titanic -f my_submission.csv -m "My first submission via CLI"
        ```

5.  **Check Your Submission Status.**
    *   After submitting, you'll get a message indicating success or failure.
    *   You can check your submission's score and status on the "My Submissions" tab of the competition page on Kaggle.com (e.g., `https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/submissions`).
    *   You can also list your recent submissions and their scores via the CLI:
        ```bash
        kaggle competitions submissions -c titanic
        ```
    *   This command will show your submission, its status (e.g., `complete`, `error`), and your public/private scores if available.

This completes the process of submitting to a Kaggle competition using the CLI!

# Tutorial: How to Submit to a Code Competition

This tutorial walks you through the process of submitting to a code competition on Kaggle.

## Step 1: Find a Code Competition

First, you need to find a code competition to participate in. You can browse the available competitions on the [Kaggle competitions page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).

## Step 2: Download the Dataset

Once you have chosen a competition, you need to download the dataset. You can do this using the `kaggle competitions download` command:

```
kaggle competitions download -c <competition-name>
```

Replace `<competition-name>` with the name of the competition you want to participate in.

## Step 3: Create a Kernel

Next, you need to create a kernel to work on your submission. A kernel is a computational environment that you can use to write and run your code. You can create a new kernel on the Kaggle website or by using the `kaggle kernels init` command.

## Step 4: Write Your Code

Now it's time to write your code! You can use any programming language or framework that you are comfortable with. The goal is to create a model that can make predictions on the test set.

## Step 5: Submit Your Predictions

Once you are happy with your model, you can submit your predictions to the competition. You can do this using the `kaggle competitions submit` command:

```
kaggle competitions submit -c <competition-name> -f <submission-file> -m <message>
```

Replace `<competition-name>` with the name of the competition, `<submission-file>` with the path to your submission file, and `<message>` with a brief description of your submission.

## Step 6: Check Your Score

After you have submitted your predictions, you can check your score on the competition leaderboard. The leaderboard shows the scores of all the participants in the competition.

That's it! You have now successfully submitted to a code competition on Kaggle.
